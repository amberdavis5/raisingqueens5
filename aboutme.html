<H2> <STRONG> <I> How I Came To Be a "Girl Mom" </I> </STRONG> </H2>
<div class="box-1"
<p> My name is Amber Davis and I have been married to my husband for 14 years. I grew up knowing that I wanted to be a mom, <br>
but I don't think that I ever <EM> dreamed </EM> that I would have four children....and all of them be girls. <br>
Soon after getting married, I got my first teaching job. During my first year teaching, I found out I was, happily, expecting! <br>
My first daughter, Cali, came in May 2013. Quickly after Cali's arrival, my next daughter, Caroline, made her appearnace in October 2014. <br>
I was knee deep into being a mom quickly with two toddlers under the age of 2. I was still working and had become a kindergarten teacher. <br>
Our plan was to see what happened as far as having a third child, but we did not have to wait long. Next arrived our Carrigan shortly after Caroline <br>
in May 2017. While I don't think we ever truly believed that we would actually have a fourth, we never pushed the idea totally out of our minds. <br>
Unexpectedly, but with pure joy, we welcomed baby daughter number four, Camree, in October 2019. Yes, you read that right...<br>
<EM>FOUR</EM> daughters!

<H4><STRONG><I>What Does Mom Like To Do?</STRONG></I></H4>
<p>While being a mom is a huge part of my identity, I also am a teacher, a wife, a friend, a sister, and so much more.<br>
I do enjoy getting to take time to do things that I really enjoy. Those things include reading mystery novels, exercising, <br>
getting a pedicure (when it's in the budget), going to movies, and going to eat with friends.
