<H2>Sunday, June 9th-- For The New Mom </H2>
<p>
As I sit back and think about bringing home that newborn baby for the first time, the main thing that comes to mind <br>
is complete and total.... fear and anxiety. Yes, I was excited. Yes, I was elated. However, the thought of taking <br>
care of another human being absolutely terrified me to death. What if she stops breathing and I am asleep? What if <br>
she doesn't use the bathroom as often as she is supposed to? What if I am doing everything completely and utterly wrong? <br>
What I came to find was all of my insecurities was all actually quite normal, and I found that out by visitng with my <br>
doctor. Having a baby is a huge life change and is something that does take some time to acclimate yourself to. <br>
Don't feel guilty. Don't feel like you're alone. I feel like all new mothers at some point and time feel lonely <br>
and like they aren't doing it all right. One thing to make sure that you are adequately able to care for your child <br>
though is to also make sure you are taking care of yourself. Here are some things that I found to be extremely helpful <br>
in my journey in settling into motherhood but also maintaining a sense of self. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a walk outside (even if it's just a short one)</li>
  <li>Take a long, hot bath</li>
  <li>Read a book (even if it's only 2 pages at a time)</li>
  <li>Talk to your closest confidants or family members </li>
  <li>Don't be afraid to share your feelings with others or ask for help </li>
  <li>ACCEPT THE HELP! Especially in the early days. </li>
  <li> If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, remember to breathe deep and take a second to regain your composure </li>
  <li> Lastly, don't be afraid to ask your doctor for recommendations if you feel that you are having a hard time adjusting to motherhood. </li>
</ul>
<H3>Sunday, June 16th--Vacationing with SO. MANY. KIDS.</H3>
<p>
<p><img src="girlsatbeach.jpg" alt="Girls at Beach" width="750" height="400"></p>
One of our favorite places to visit as a family is Coligny Beach Park in Hilton Head, South Carolina.<br>
That's actually where we are planning on going coming up very soon and my girls are extremely excited. <br>
While the excitement of vacation is something I love, I also have the dread of the packing, planning, <br>
and organizing that is inevitably upon me. With such a large family that is a huge task. Making sure <br>
everyone has their proper amount of clothing, bathing suits, shoes, electronics, snacks, drinks, <br>
and the list can honestly be overwhelmingly endless. To keep myself organized I make a list and check <br>
off things as I get them accomplished. Cali needs 5 pairs of shorts, 5 tanks, 3 bathing suits, 2 pairs<br>
of shoes, and her iPad? Check, check, and check. By clumping each person together along with their <br>
individual needs for the trip, it allows me to check off individual lists as I get them packed. <br>
Each individual person has their list, including myself, and each person helps gather their own things. <br>
By making packing a family effort, it takes the load off of just one person. It works for my family and when <br>
they have their own lists to go by, check off as they go, and then compile the suitcase. This is a little tidbit <br>
that works for our family, and maybe it's something that may work for yours! The only things to make sure of when <br>
traveling with your family it to remember to have fun! You're making memories with your family that will hopefully <br>
last a lifetime. Remember to always find joy in the journey. <br>
